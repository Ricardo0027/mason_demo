## Overview

The **Mason Demo** is designed to help developers understand how to structure a Flutter application using Clean Architecture. By separating concerns into different layers, this architecture promotes scalability and maintainability. The app is a simple demonstration but provides a solid foundation for building more complex applications.

## Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with layers for presentation, domain, and data.
- **BLoC Pattern**: Efficient state management using the BLoC pattern.
- **Code Generation**: Utilizes Mason for generating boilerplate code quickly.
- **Demo App**: A fully functional demo that illustrates the core concepts.
- **Example Project**: Serves as a reference for developers starting with Flutter and Clean Architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.
- **Dart**: The programming language used for Flutter development.
- **BLoC**: A design pattern for managing state in Flutter applications.
- **Mason**: A tool for code generation in Dart and Flutter projects.
- **Clean Architecture**: A software design philosophy that promotes separation of concerns.

## Installation

To get started with the **Mason Demo**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ricardo0027/mason_demo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mason_demo
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start exploring the app. The main screen will display a simple interface that demonstrates the functionality of the app. You can interact with various components to see how the BLoC pattern manages state.

### Code Generation with Mason

To generate code using Mason, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Mason installed. If not, you can install it via Dart:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate mason_cli
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
   ```bash
   mason make <brick-name>
   ```

Replace `<brick-name>` with the name of the brick you want to generate.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of the project is organized as follows:

```
